# Unit annotations (the `x-unit` family)

Sienna schemas carry units as JSON Schema extension keywords (the `x-` prefix
keeps them outside the validated vocabulary so draft-07 tooling ignores them).
This document specifies the family and the rules `scripts/validate_units.py`
enforces on every schema in `Core/`, `Operations/`, `Investments/`, and
`Dynamics/`.

## The vocabulary lives in `Core/units.json`

`Core/units.json` is the single source of truth for the unit vocabulary. It
lists the `quantity_types` (name, dimension, default unit) and `allowed_units`
(the exact `(quantity_type, unit)` pairs and their conversion factor to the
default unit).

**Every unit string an annotation names must be a `unit` from
`Core/units.json` `allowed_units`, or the literal `"pu"`.** No other spellings
are allowed.

## The annotation keywords

### `x-unit`

A single unit string for a numeric property. The value is either:

- a unit from the `Core/units.json` vocabulary (e.g. `"MW"`, `"kV"`, `"ohm"`,
  `"MMBtu/MWh"`), or
- the literal `"pu"` (per-unit).

A bare `"pu"` with no `x-unit-base` means the value is per-unit on the component's
own recorded base (`base_power`, or `base_current` for `TModelHVDCLine`); there is no
system-base option — components whose per-unit data was historically on the system base
record that base in `base_power`. For the four branch-impedance quantities (Resistance,
Reactance, Susceptance, Conductance) and for the power-family quantities (ActivePower,
ReactivePower, ApparentPower, and `pu/min` for ActivePowerChangeRate), `pu` **is a
registered vocabulary unit** (`to_default: null`, since the pu→natural conversion depends
on the recorded base rather than a fixed factor). Branch impedance is one of two
discriminated storage options in the downstream registry: GridDB stores each branch
parameter in either per-unit or natural units and records which per row via
`transmission_lines.parameter_units` (`COMPONENT_BASE` → `pu`; `NATURAL_UNITS` → `ohm`/`S`).
The power-family quantities are discriminated the same way at the schema layer, via each
component's own `power_units`.
Elsewhere, `"pu"` remains purely an annotation channel; no other quantity registers `pu`.

```json
"rating": { "type": "number", "x-unit": "MVA" }
"g":      { "type": "number", "x-unit": "pu" }
```

### `x-unit-base`

Names a **sibling property** that holds the natural-unit base for a per-unit
value. Use it when `"pu"` is on a device/local base rather than the system
base — for example a bus voltage in per-unit of its own `base_voltage`.

```json
"magnitude":    { "type": "number", "x-unit": "pu", "x-unit-base": "base_voltage" },
"base_voltage": { "type": "number", "x-unit": "kV" }
```

The named property must exist in the same object's `properties`.

### `x-unit-discriminator` + `x-units`

For a property whose unit depends on the value of another (sibling)
property, `x-unit-discriminator` names that sibling and `x-units` maps each
discriminator value to its unit.

The most common discriminator is `power_units`: every component with a power-family field
(active/reactive/apparent power, ratings, limits, ramp rates) carries a `power_units`
property of type `UnitSystem`, and every such field is annotated against it. Unlike
`parameter_units` and the other per-family discriminators, which typically default to
`COMPONENT_BASE` or `NATURAL_UNITS`, **`power_units` carries no default** — a producer must
always set it explicitly. A new component with power-family fields needs both: the
`power_units` property itself, and an `x-unit-discriminator`/`x-units` pair on every field it
governs.

```json
"level_data_type": { "$ref": "../../Core/common.json#/definitions/ReservoirDataType" },
"inflow": {
  "$ref": "../../Core/common.json#/definitions/MinMax",
  "x-unit-discriminator": "level_data_type",
  "x-units": {
    "USABLE_VOLUME": "m3/s",
    "TOTAL_VOLUME":  "m3/s",
    "HEAD":          "m/s",
    "ENERGY":        "MW"
  }
}
```

Rules:

- `x-unit-discriminator` must name an existing sibling property.
- The `x-units` **key set must exactly equal the discriminator's enum**. The
  discriminator may be:
  - an inline `enum`,
  - a `$ref` to an enum definition (resolved into `Core/common.json`, e.g.
    `ReservoirDataType`), or
  - a `boolean` — whose effective key set is `"true"` and `"false"`:

    ```json
    "power_mode":       { "type": "boolean" },
    "transfer_setpoint": {
      "x-unit-discriminator": "power_mode",
      "x-units": { "true": "MW", "false": "A" }
    }
    ```

- Every value in `x-units` must be in the vocabulary (or `"pu"`).

#### Nested discriminators (multi-dimensional units)

A property's unit sometimes depends on **two** siblings. The canonical case is a
VSC converter setpoint: the control mode selects the *quantity* (power vs
voltage), and for the voltage modes a unit-basis sibling then selects pu vs kV.
An `x-units` **value** may therefore be either a unit string (leaf) or a nested
`{ "x-unit-discriminator": <sibling>, "x-units": { ... } }` object:

```json
"dc_control_from": { "$ref": "../../Core/common.json#/definitions/VSCDCControlModes" },
"voltage_units":   { "$ref": "../../Core/common.json#/definitions/VoltageUnitBasis" },
"dc_setpoint_from": {
  "type": "number",
  "x-unit-discriminator": "dc_control_from",
  "x-units": {
    "DC_POWER": "MW",
    "DC_VOLTAGE":       { "x-unit-discriminator": "voltage_units",
                          "x-units": { "COMPONENT_BASE": "pu", "NATURAL_UNITS": "kV" } },
    "DC_VOLTAGE_DROOP": { "x-unit-discriminator": "voltage_units",
                          "x-units": { "COMPONENT_BASE": "pu", "NATURAL_UNITS": "kV" } }
  }
}
```

Rules (applied recursively to every nesting level):

- Each nested object must have both `x-unit-discriminator` and `x-units`.
- The nested discriminator must name an existing sibling of the annotated
  property, and its `x-units` key set must exactly equal that sibling's enum.
- Leaf values must be vocabulary units (or `"pu"`).

### `x-quantity`

A unit does not always say what the number *is*. Five units in the vocabulary
name more than one quantity type:

| Unit | Quantity types |
|---|---|
| `pu` | ActivePower, ApparentPower, Conductance, Reactance, ReactivePower, Resistance, Susceptance, Voltage |
| `1` | Dimensionless, Fraction, PowerFactor |
| `ohm` | Impedance, Reactance, Resistance |
| `S` | Conductance, Susceptance |
| `m` | Elevation, Length |

`x-quantity` names the intended one. It is either a **quantity-type string** —
every ambiguous unit on the property means that quantity — or a **unit ->
quantity object**, for a property whose branches genuinely disagree:

```json
"magnitude":   { "type": "number", "x-unit": "pu", "x-quantity": "Voltage" },

"active_power": {
  "type": "number",
  "x-unit-discriminator": "power_units",
  "x-units": { "NATURAL_UNITS": "MW", "COMPONENT_BASE": "pu" },
  "x-quantity": "ActivePower"
},

"ac_setpoint": {
  "x-unit-discriminator": "ac_control",
  "x-units": { "AC_POWER_FACTOR": "1", "AC_VOLTAGE": "pu" },
  "x-quantity": { "1": "PowerFactor", "pu": "Voltage" }
}
```

#### When it is required

Only where **sibling inference** cannot settle the unit. Within a single
`x-units` map, a branch whose unit names exactly one quantity pins that quantity
for the map, and an ambiguous branch beside it means the same thing. So
`{ NATURAL_UNITS: MW, COMPONENT_BASE: pu }` needs no declaration — `MW` is
unambiguously ActivePower, therefore so is the `pu` branch. That covers the
power-family pattern every component with power fields uses.

Inference is deliberately conservative: the pin must also be a candidate for
every ambiguous branch in the same map, or nothing is inferred. This is what
keeps the `COMPONENT_MVAR` shunt bases honest. A magnetizing shunt's
`{ NATURAL_UNITS: S, COMPONENT_MVAR: MVAr, COMPONENT_BASE: pu }` would otherwise
pin ReactivePower off the `MVAr` branch, but the property is a **Susceptance** —
`COMPONENT_MVAR` stores a power at unity voltage, not the property's own
quantity. `S` is not a ReactivePower unit, so inference refuses and the schema
declares `"x-quantity": "Susceptance"`.

Declaration therefore beats inference; inference beats failure. A declaration
may resolve what inference cannot, but it may not **contradict** it — `pu`
legally names Voltage, so nothing but the sibling `MW` branch makes
`"x-quantity": "Voltage"` wrong on an `active_power`, and rule 7 rejects it.

`x-quantity` is rejected on a property whose units are already unambiguous:
`MVA` names ApparentPower and nothing else, so declaring it there is noise.

Consumers read this instead of maintaining their own lookup table. The Julia
model generator's `declared_quantity` accessors come from `x-quantity` plus
inference; it carries no quantity table of its own.

## `$ref` siblings: where annotations sit, and who reads them

Most `x-unit*` annotations in this repo sit beside a `$ref` (a property that is a
`MinMax`, say) rather than inside the referenced definition. Under OpenAPI 3.1 a
keyword beside `$ref` applies, and both code generators honor it: `description`
and `default` reach the generated code, and the `Units:` sentence in the
description is what carries the unit. `scripts/validate_units.py` reads the raw
files, so it sees the annotations wherever they sit.

One consequence to know about: the Julia generator treats an `x-` key beside a
`$ref` as a constraint and emits a per-site copy of the referenced type
(`ACBusVoltageLimits` for a `MinMax`). That is generator behavior, not a schema
error; the Julia package's own dedup pass collapses the copies.

## Bundling: `scripts/bundle_specs.py`

The Julia generator resolves cross-file `$ref`s itself, but it resolves
`discriminator.mapping` values only inside a single document. So for each
`openapi-<domain>.json` selector the bundler writes
`dist/openapi-<domain>-bundled.json`, one self-contained document:

- `components.schemas` holds every schema the selector reaches, once, under one
  name: the selector's key, else the `$defs` key, else the file stem.
- Every `$ref` becomes `#/components/schemas/<Name>`; the keys beside it stay.
- `discriminator.mapping` values are references resolved relative to the file
  that contains them, exactly like `$ref`, and are rewritten the same way. A
  mapping inside `Core/common.json` reads `#/$defs/X`; one inside a component
  file reads `../../Core/common.json#/$defs/X`; one naming a whole sibling file
  reads `SingleTimeSeries.json#`. Every mapping value carries a `#`, so it reads
  as a reference rather than a bare schema name.
- Nothing is inlined or merged, and there is no root `$defs` block.
- Output is deterministic (selector order, then pulled-in names sorted), so
  `--check` compares bytes against a fresh in-memory bundle and fails CI on
  stale or missing `dist/` output.

`dist/` is generated and git-ignored. Never hand-edit it; regenerate with
`python scripts/bundle_specs.py`.

## The description channel (`--fix-descriptions` / `--check-descriptions`)

Descriptions are the only annotation channel that reaches generated Julia/Python
code today, so **every property carrying `x-unit` or `x-units` must have a
description ending with a canonical `Units:` sentence.**

Format:

- **Plain `x-unit`:** the description ends with `Units: <x-unit>.` — e.g.
  `... Units: MVA.`
- **Discriminated (`x-units` map):** `Units: per <discriminator> — <VAL>: <unit>, ... .`
  The `<VAL>: <unit>` pairs are the `x-units` entries in map (insertion) order,
  comma-separated, joined to the discriminator name with an em dash (`—`), and
  the sentence terminates with a space + period. Example:

  ```
  Units: per level_data_type — USABLE_VOLUME: m3/s, TOTAL_VOLUME: m3/s, HEAD: m/s, ENERGY: MW .
  ```

`scripts/validate_units.py --fix-descriptions` applies this **idempotently**: it
strips any trailing `Units: ...` sentence and re-appends the current one, so
running it twice changes nothing (a stale sentence is replaced, never
duplicated); a property with no description gets one consisting solely of the
sentence. `--check-descriptions` is the CI mode and exits non-zero if any
annotated property's description is not exactly the canonical form.

## Conventions this vocabulary encodes

- **Interchange carries natural units by default, with two deliberate per-unit
  exceptions.** Branch electrical parameters (`r`/`x`/`b`/`g`) may be stored in
  per-unit *or* natural units, and the storage layer records which per row
  (GridDB `transmission_lines.parameter_units`: `COMPONENT_BASE` → `pu`,
  `NATURAL_UNITS` → `ohm`/`S`). Every component's power-family fields
  (active/reactive/apparent power, ratings, limits, ramp rates) carry the same
  option: the component's own `power_units` — required, no default — selects
  `pu` (`COMPONENT_BASE`, against that component's `base_power`) or the
  physical unit (`NATURAL_UNITS`) for every power-family field it has.
  `Core/units.json` carries the `pu` rows for `ActivePower`, `ReactivePower`,
  `ApparentPower`, and `pu/min` for `ActivePowerChangeRate` that back this. For
  every other quantity, natural units only, and `"pu"` is a model-layer
  annotation, not a stored unit.
- **Percent is banned.** Fractions and dimensionless quantities use the unit
  `"1"` and are stored as fractions (`0.95`, not `95`). There is no `"%"` unit.
- **`unit` / `units` string properties.** Any property literally named `unit`
  or `units` and typed `string` (e.g. `TimeSeries/SingleTimeSeries.json`'s
  `units`) must have a description pointing at `Core/units.json` — its value
  is a free-text unit string that must come from the vocabulary. This is
  enforced as rule 6. (`TimeSeries/TimeSeriesAssociation.json` is the `oneOf`
  wrapper over the six per-type schemas and carries no `units` property of
  its own, so it is not this rule's example.)

## Maintaining the vocabulary

To add or change a unit:

1. **Edit `Core/units.json`** — add the `quantity_type` and/or the
   `allowed_units` `(quantity_type, unit, to_default)` row. This is the only
   place the vocabulary is defined.
2. **Regenerate the SiennaGridDB unit registry** from the updated
   `Core/units.json` (GridDB's `scripts/generate_unit_registry.py`) so the
   database's `quantity_types` / `allowed_units` tables stay in sync.

Never introduce a unit spelling in a schema annotation without first adding it
to `Core/units.json`; `scripts/validate_units.py` will reject it.

## What the validator checks

`scripts/validate_units.py` (stdlib + `jsonschema` only) enforces, over every
schema JSON under `Core/`, `Operations/`, `Investments/`, `Dynamics/`
(excluding `Core/units.json` and the `openapi-*.json` specs):

1. Each schema validates against the **draft-07 meta-schema**.
2. Every `x-unit` / `x-units` value is in `Core/units.json` `allowed_units`, or
   `"pu"`.
3. Every `x-unit-base` and `x-unit-discriminator` names an existing sibling
   property.
4. Every `x-units` key set exactly equals the discriminator's enum (resolving a
   `$ref` discriminator into `Core/common.json`; a boolean discriminator has
   keys `"true"` / `"false"`).
5. No `"descriptor"` keys and no `"type": null` anywhere.
6. Every `unit` / `units` string property has a description mentioning
   `Core/units.json` or the vocabulary.
7. Every property whose unit is ambiguous resolves to one quantity type:
   `x-quantity` is present where sibling inference cannot settle it, names a
   quantity registered for that unit, does not contradict what the sibling
   branches imply, and is absent where the units are already unambiguous.

It runs in CI (`.github/workflows/validate-schemas.yml`) on every push and pull
request and exits non-zero on any failure.
